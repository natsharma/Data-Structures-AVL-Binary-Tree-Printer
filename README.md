# Data Structures Project: AVL (self-balancing binary) Tree Printer
## Populates a Binary Search Tree (AVL Tree) and prints out its contents.  

Populates a Binary Search Tree   (BST), specifically an AVL tree and print out its contents.

## To Run the Program
* Clone project and put all .java files in the same directory.
* Then configure a path to make the sourcecode.jar file work. This is the library that my code uses. 
* Run the program
* (Example inputs are already coded into the program. You can change them in the code if you want.)

## Expected Results:

## Logic:
My printTree, printTree1, and print2DArray methods are recursive methods. Around 30 lines of code.
